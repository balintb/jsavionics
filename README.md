HTML5 aviation instrument library for Javascript.

Heard of jQuery UI?
This library aims to be the jQUI of aviation.

The following instruments will be implemented:

- Artificial horizon
- Variometer
- Altimeter
- Turn coordinator

Other instruments are planned, with an ability to plug instruments together.

This library is part of a larger project to build an instrument panel in JS for the [Crazyflie](http://www.bitcraze.se/crazyflie/) nano quadcopter.
